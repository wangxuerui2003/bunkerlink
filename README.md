## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Buckerlink stems from the urgent need to protect citizens from Kaiji, formidable alien predators that pose a significant threat to public safety. With increasing sightings and encounters reported worldwide, there's a critical necessity for a robust solution that enables real-time communication and emergency response capabilities.

## What it does

Buckerlink is a comprehensive mobile application designed to empower users in the face of Kaiji threats. Built using Flutter and Dart, the app utilizes a sophisticated Pocketbase serverless architecture coupled with the Google Maps API to deliver essential functionalities:

- **Nearby Chat Rooms:** Users can join public chat rooms dedicated to Kaiji sightings and updates. This facilitates community interaction and real-time information sharing, crucial for staying informed and vigilant.
- **Map Functionality:** The app features an interactive map interface powered by Google Maps API. Users can pinpoint nearby underground bunkers where they can seek refuge in case of Kaiji encounters. The map provides detailed directions and information about each bunker's capacity and safety features.
- **SOS Button:** In emergencies, users can activate the SOS button within the app. This triggers immediate alerts to nearby users and relevant authorities, ensuring prompt assistance and coordinated response efforts.

## How we built it

Development of Buckerlink involved leveraging cutting-edge technologies:

- **Flutter and Dart:** Used for building a cross-platform, visually appealing user interface that ensures a seamless experience across devices.
- **Pocketbase Serverless Architecture:** Adopted to handle backend operations efficiently without the need for managing infrastructure, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Google Maps API Integration:** Implemented for precise location services, enabling accurate mapping of nearby bunkers and real-time navigation.

## Challenges we ran into

During development, we encountered several challenges, primarily related to the adoption of Pocketbase, a relatively new technology:

- **Documentation and Support:** Due to the nascent stage of Pocketbase, we faced initial hurdles in accessing comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting resources.
- **Integration Complexity:** Integrating Google Maps API seamlessly within the app while ensuring optimal performance and accuracy posed technical challenges that required careful planning and testing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, we achieved significant milestones:

- **Successful Map Implementation:** We successfully integrated and refined the map functionality within Buckerlink, offering users an intuitive and visually appealing interface for navigating Kaiji-safe zones.
- **User-Centric Design:** The app's design prioritizes user experience, ensuring that critical features like chat rooms, bunker mapping, and emergency alerts are easily accessible and user-friendly.

## What we learned

Developing Buckerlink taught us invaluable lessons in rapid prototyping and adapting to emerging technologies:

- **Agile Development:** We embraced rapid prototyping methodologies to iterate quickly and incorporate user feedback, ensuring Buckerlink meets evolving user needs effectively.
- **Technology Adoption:** Our experience with Pocketbase underscored the importance of thorough research and proactive adaptation to new technologies in application development.

## What's next for Buckerlink

Looking forward, our roadmap for Buckerlink includes pioneering advancements leveraging AI technology to further enhance user safety and community engagement:

- **Predictive Analytics:** Introduce predictive analytics powered by machine learning models to anticipate Kaiji movements and proactively alert users in high-risk areas, enhancing preemptive safety measures.
- **Personalized Safety Recommendations:** Utilize AI-driven data insights to provide personalized safety recommendations based on user behavior patterns and historical Kaiji activity in their vicinity.
